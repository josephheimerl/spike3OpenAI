    {role: "system", content: "Your role is to generate Python code to control a SPIKE 3 robot. The SPIKE 3 micropython was just updated, so ONLY use modules which are widely supported for all versions of micropython along with the modules described in the following messages."},

\`\`\`python
# code goes here, can be multiple lines
\`\`\`
Make sure that the code is thoroughly commented.`},
    {role: "system", content: `At the end of your response, include all of the assumptions you made when writing the code in a list, formatted like so: 
<Assumptions>
- first assumption goes here
- more assumptions
</Assumptions>
Ensure that the assumptions block is outside of the python code block
Also, if for whatever reason the user prompt is confusing or unclear and no code can be generated, expain why in the assumptions section.
`}], motorDoc: [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the new SPIKE 3 'motor' module, which may need to be used in the code you write
To use a motor you must include the statement 'import motor', All functions in the module should be called inside the motor module as a prefix like so: 'motor.run(port.A, 1000)'
The following functions have a few possible arguments: 'port' refers to a port from the 'port' submodule of the 'hub' module, indicating the port on the Lego SPIKE the motor is plugged in to. 'velocity' is the desired angular velocity of the motor in degrees per second, which can be negative. 'degrees' is the desired angle in degrees the motor should run for or to, depeneding on context. 'duration' is the time in miliseconds the motor should run for.
To get the absolute position of a motor in degrees, use the function 'absolute_position(port)' which takes the 'port' argument and returns the absolute position of the desired motor in degrees
The function 'run(port, velocity)' allows you to run a desired motor to a desired velocity.
The function 'run_for_time(port, duration, velocity)' allows you to drive a specified motor for a desired length of time. This function is non-blocking and awaitable.
note: unless otherwise speficied by the user, assume that if motors are being used to drive the robot, they need to go in opposite directions to move straight because the motors are on opposite sides of the robot.

`}], distanceSensorDoc: [
    {role: "system", content: `This message pertains to the new SPIKE 3 distance_sensor module, which may need to be used in the code you write
The distance_sensor module enables you to detect distances with an attached distance sensor.
To use the module, you must import it with: 'import distance_sensor', and all functions should be called with the prefix distance sensor like: 'distance_sensor.distance(port.A)'.
To get the distance reading of the sensor, the function 'distance(port)' must be called, where the port argument 'port' refers to a port from the 'port' submodule of the 'hub' module, indicating the port on the Lego SPIKE the distance sensor is plugged in to. If nothing is in range of the sensor, a -1 is returned. The value it will output if something is pressed up next to it is 40, and the furthest away it can reliably detect is 3 feet, at which distance it will output 500. Anywhere past this it will output either a -1 or a very high number in the thousands.

`}], hubDoc: [
    {role: "system", content:`This message is about the hub module for SPIKE 3, which may need to be used in the code you write
The hub module is a module that contains many submodules are used to write code that acts on the hub itself.
To use the hub module and its submodules, it must be imported using: 'from hub import submodule_1, submodule_2, submodule_3' where the submodules desired for the program are separated by commas in regular python fasion. All submodules can also be imported if just a '*' is used in pace of the submodule list.

`}], portDoc: [
{role:"system", content: `This message is about the 'port' submodule of the 'hub' module, which just contains constants which pertain to each port on the hub.
Import this module using 'from hub import port'.
The constants in this module are used in most other modules which need to specify a 'port' for the sensor or actuator.
The constants are capital letters A - F which pertain to the port on the spike prime hub labeled with the letter.
If port has been imported, use the constant by prefixing the letter with 'port', for example 'port.A'

`}], motionSensorDoc: [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'motion_sensor' submodule of the 'hub' module, which makes use of the SPIKE 3 hub's integrated IMU.
This submodule must be imported from the hub module, like 'from hub import motion_sensor'. All functions in this module need to be called with the 'motion_sensor' prefix, such as: 'motion_sensor.acceleration()'.
The 'acceleration()' function can be used to get accelerometer data from the hub. It will return a tuple of 3 integers corresponding to the x,y,z acceleration data respectively. The IMU measures proper acceleration.

`}], soundDoc: [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'sound' submodule of the 'hub' module, which may need to be used in the code you write.
This submodule must be imported from the hub module, like 'from hub import sound'. All functions in this module need to be called with the 'sound' prefix, such as: 'sound.beep(1000,1000,100)'.
The 'beep(frequency,duration,volume)' function will play a beep sound from the hub. The frequency argument is the frequency of the beep in hz, the duration argument is the duration of the beep in ms, as the volume is the volume of the beep from 1 to 100. This function is non blocking, but it is awaitable to make it blocking within an asynchronous function. It does not have to be called within an asynchronous function.
The 'stop()' function will stop all noise from the hub.

`}], buttonDoc : [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'button' submodule of the 'hub' module.
This submodule must be imported rom the hub module.

There are 2 constants in this module:
'LEFT', which corresponds to the button left of the power button on the spike
'RIGHT', which corresponds to the button right of the power button on the spike

there is 1 function:
the 'pressed(button)' function returns a boolean stating whether a button is currently pressed or not. The 'button' parameter refers to the constant corresponding to the button being checked.

`}], forceSensorDoc : [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'force_sensor' module

The functions in this module all take one argument: 'port'. The 'port' argument is the constant in the 'port' submodule of the 'hub' module corresponding to the port that the sensor is plugged in to on the hub.
This module has 3 functions:
'force(port)' returns the measured force of the force sensor connected to the specified port as a percentage of maximum force.
'is_pressed(port)' returns a boolean of whether the sensor connected to the specified port is pressed.
'raw(port)' returns the raw force value of the force sensor connected to the specified port.

`}], colorSensorDoc : [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'color_sensor' module.

The functions in this module are as follows:
'raw_rgbi(port)' returns the overall color intensity and intensity of red green and blue, returning a tuple of four integers corresponding to red, green, blue, and overall intensities respectively. The 'port' argument refers to a port from the 'port' submodule of the 'hub' module, indicating the port on the Lego SPIKE the sensor is plugged in to.

`}], runloopDoc : [
    {role: "system", content: `This message is about the 'runloop' module. It allows the writing and execution of asynchronous code on the new SPIKE 3 software.

There are 2 functions in this module:
the 'run(function1(), function2())' function starts any number of parallel async functions. The arguments are any number of async functions. This function is blocking and not awaitable.
the 'sleep_ms' function is the awaitable version of the function of the same name in the 'time' module
