'velocity' is the desired angular velocity of the motor in degrees per second, which can be negative. 'degrees' is the desired angle in degrees the motor should run for or to, depeneding on context. 'duration' is the time in miliseconds the motor should run for.\nTo get the absolute position of a motor in degrees, use the function 'absolute_position(port)' which takes the 'port' argument and returns the absolute position of the desired motor in degrees\nThe function 'run(port, velocity)' allows you to run a desired motor to a desired velocity.\nThe function 'run_for_time(port, duration, velocity)' allows you to drive a specified motor for a desired length of time. This function is non-blocking and awaitable.\nnote: unless otherwise speficied by the user, assume that if motors are being used to drive the robot, they need to go in opposite directions to move straight because the motors are on opposite sides of the robot.\n\n"

If nothing is in range of the sensor, a -1 is returned. The value it will output if something is pressed up next to it is 40, and the furthest away it can reliably detect is 3 feet, at which distance it will output 500.
